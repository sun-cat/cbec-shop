# Shopify App Node

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE.md)

This is a sample app to help developers bootstrap their Shopify app development.

It leverages the [Shopify API Library](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) on the backend to create [an embedded app](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge/getting-started#embed-your-app-in-the-shopify-admin), and [Polaris](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react) and [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge/getting-started/using-react) on the frontend.

This is the repository used when you create a new Node app with the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli).

## Requirements

- If you don’t have one, [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup).
- If you don’t have one, [create a Development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) where you can install and test your app.

# With npm
npm init @shopify/app@latest -- --template=node
# OR with yarn
